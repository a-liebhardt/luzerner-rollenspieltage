This is the modular standard element to display and server text components. It setuped to sever every combination of structured text content in different usecases. It must not serve any hard styles.

Every article can fit an `header`, an `main` and an `footer` part. The `header` serves all headline related stuff like title, sub title and meta titles. The `main` area holds your text body. And the `footer` part mostly is used for sub informations like it is used in a news article.
